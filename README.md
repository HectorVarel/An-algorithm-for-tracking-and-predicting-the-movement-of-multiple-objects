# An-algorithm-for-tracking-and-predicting-the-movement-of-multiple-objects
Using a camera, the movement of multiple objects (fish) is analyzed and their tracking is performed. For detection, a YOLOv5 network was retrained to identify the fish. Experiments were also conducted with alternative detection approaches such as Connected Component Analysis and Siamese Neural Networks.
